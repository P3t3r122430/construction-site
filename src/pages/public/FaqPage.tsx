      question: 'What does ApexBuild’s NCA 1 Tier-1 Registration mean for my project?',
      category: 'Accreditation & Safety',
      answer: 'The National Construction Authority (NCA 1) category is the highest tier of contractor registration in Kenya and East Africa. It certifies that ApexBuild possesses unlimited financial, plant, equipment, and structural engineering capacity to execute projects of unlimited monetary value. It provides institutional lenders, pension funds, and private developers with legal certainty that our technical team and safety protocols meet stringent statutory benchmarks.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do you structure payment milestones and contractual valuations?',
      category: 'Commercial Terms',
      answer: 'We utilize standard FIDIC (Red, Yellow, or Silver Book) and JBC (Joint Building Council) contract standards. Payments are tied strictly to certified interim valuation certificates issued by the project Quantity Surveyor after rigorous on-site verification of measured works. We maintain open-book transparency throughout the build lifecycle.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you assist clients with county government approvals and statutory permits?',
      category: 'Statutory Compliance',
      answer: 'Yes. Our in-house technical liaison unit coordinates end-to-end statutory permitting, including National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), County Government Architectural & Structural approvals, NCA Project Registration, Water Resources Authority (WRA) clearances, and utility connections.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What structural warranties and defect liability periods do you provide?',
      category: 'Quality & Warranties',
      answer: 'Upon practical completion, all ApexBuild projects enter a standard 6 to 12-month Defects Liability Period (DLP) during which any latent snags are remediated immediately. Furthermore, all primary reinforced concrete and structural steel frameworks carry our signature 10-Year Structural Integrity Warranty backed by comprehensive contractor all-risk (CAR) insurance.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does ApexBuild ensure Zero-Harm Safety on active construction sites?',
      category: 'Accreditation & Safety',
      answer: 'We operate under a strict ISO 45001 (Occupational Health & Safety) framework. Every site has full-time registered safety officers, mandatory morning toolbox briefings, 100% PPE compliance, perimeter edge-protection scaffolding, and full stop-work authority for every operative.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you work on design-and-build (turnkey EPC) arrangements?',
      category: 'Delivery Models',
      answer: 'Absolutely. We offer complete Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) turnkey delivery. In this model, ApexBuild assumes single-point responsibility for architectural design, structural engineering, MEP coordination, procurement, and physical execution, reducing schedule overlap and cost overrun risks.'
